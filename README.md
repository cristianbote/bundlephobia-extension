# Bundlephobia Web Extension

This is a web extension that wraps the super awesome tool, **Bundlephobia(https://bundlephobia.com/)**, with whom you can check the size of a package directly in your browser, without the need to open a new tab, when viewing it on **github** or **npmjs**.

## How to get it
You can install it via the Chrome Web Store link https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bundlephobia-web-extension/dliifhggbnajibohfjcpiedlfjmoneko or download the crx file manually from releases.

## Usage
Simply navigate to a certain repo either on github or on npmjs and click on the icon in your browser bar.

A popup should appear with your results.

## Credits
This could've not been made without the work of Shubham Kanodia (https://github.com/pastelsky) who created Bundlephobia. Such a great tool! Thank you!

## Only github and npmjs?
Well, yarn reports the size already. I was thinking to add gitlab and bitbucket maybe? Let me know if these are of interest, and as always feel free to raise issues where needed.
